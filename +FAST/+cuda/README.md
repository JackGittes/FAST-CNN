NOTE: PTX file is compiled from NVCC and Clang compiler. 
Make sure you have installed both compilers in your system. Clang compiler 
in Win64 OS can be found in Visual Studio directory generally.

The script for compiling .PTX file is:
    nvcc -cuda x.cu -keep
NOTE:
    Current version PTX codes in +cuda folder are generated by a CUDA 10.0
nvcc compiler which is used for RTX 2080 Ti GPU. If your GPU computation
compability is less than RTX 2080 Ti or CUDA version is not 10.0, you will
probably re-compile PTX codes on your machine.
